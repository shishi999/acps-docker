# This a period of time, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates
# when a node is deemed to be inactive and is removed from the list
# of nodes of a cluster (nor will it appear in the 'monitoring' section of the application).
#
# When a node is properly shut down, it will send out an event indicating
# it is shut down. From that point on, the data will be kept in memory for the amount
# of time indicated here.
# When a node is not properly shut down (eg hardware failure), this is the period of time
# before removal, since the time the last event is received.
#
# Make sure the value here is higher than the sending interval of the nodes, to avoid
# that nodes incorrectly removed.
#
# By default 10 minutes
cluster.monitoring.max.inactive.time=600000

# A cron expression that configures when the check for inactive nodes is made.
# When executed, this will mark any node that hasn't been active for 'cluster.monitoring.max.inactive.time'
# seconds, as an inactive node. Default: every 5 minutes.
